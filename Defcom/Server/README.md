# Chat Server

### Install

The chat server requires a running version of python 2.7 (https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
and a running version of the Tornado framework (http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/).

### Running
The server can be started by running the main.py file. (No command line arguments required)
After startup the program automatically starts listening on port 8888. The required event handlers are registered automatically, no further user action is required. The app is ready to receive user request.
 
### Debugging
The server application performs basic logging to the console, allowing the developers, to follow the behaviour of the application.
